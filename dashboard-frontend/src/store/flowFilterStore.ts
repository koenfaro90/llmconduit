/**
 * The SHARED FlowTable filter (D12). The FlowTable (D10) used to own its filter in component
 * `useState`, which made it unreachable from the other views. D12's Topology (click a provider
 * node) and Sankey (click a flow band) must be able to drive that same filter — "click here →
 * see those flows" — so the filter is hoisted into this tiny vanilla-zustand store (the same
 * `createStore` + `useSyncExternalStore` bridge the dashboard/auth stores use). The FlowTable
 * reads it (it remains the ONLY writer of the chip toggles); Topology/Sankey set it, then
 * `navigate('flows')` so the cross-link lands on the table already filtered.
 *
 * It is deliberately separate from `dashboardStore` (the live WS/seek state): the filter is pure
 * UI selection that must survive view switches and is NOT cleared by a seek/teardown of the live
 * data. Keeping it out of `dashboardStore` also means a filter change never invalidates the live
 * slices' selectors.
