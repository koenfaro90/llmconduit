//! D13 — the `/dashboard/api/*` REST surface: the capstone that makes Phase 0's
//! stores (D1 FlowStore, D4 topology, D5 metrics/snapshots, D6 kill) reachable by
//! the SPA. Every handler takes `State(Arc<Gateway>)`; the routes register ONLY in
//! the `--with-debug-ui` block (http.rs), behind D7a's session auth + `no_store`.
//!
//! ## Wire contract (FROZEN — `dashboard-frontend/src/api/types.ts`)
//! The JSON these handlers emit must match the SPA's runtime validators
//! byte-for-byte (field names, nesting, per-domain `seq` cursors). The cursor-
//! bearing reads (`/flows`, `/flows/:id`, `/metrics`, `/topology`, `/snapshot`)
//! each carry their OWN domain's sequence — never a single global watermark
//! (AGENTS.md per-domain `{domain, seq}` rule). `/catalog` is the lone BARE array
//! (a static-ish read, not a mutating domain).
//!
//! ## Shape reuse (REST == WS)
//! `/metrics` returns a [`crate::dashboard_ws::MetricsSnapshot`] and `/topology` a
//! [`crate::dashboard_ws::TopologySnapshot`] — the SAME structs the `/dashboard/ws`
//! initial snapshot ships, so the REST body and the WS snapshot body are identical
//! shapes (the SPA decodes both with one validator). The flow rows + detail add a
//! `cost` roll-up the body-free [`SnapshotFlowSummary`] does not carry, so this
//! module defines the cost-bearing [`FlowRow`]/[`FlowDetailBody`] projections.
//!
//! ## Rates + cost (D13's job, not D5's)
//! The WS `window_tile` ships RAW window counts in the rate fields and `0.0` cost
//! (it has no window-seconds or price table). D13's REST view divides by the true
//! window seconds and prices every bucket via [`crate::config::Config::price_for`],
//! so `reqs_per_sec`/`tokens_per_sec`/`cost_per_min`/`cost_per_sec` are real rates.
//! `active_streams` is the live count of OPEN flows (the metrics rings don't track
//! liveness; the FlowStore does).
