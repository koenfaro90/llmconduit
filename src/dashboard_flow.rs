//! D1 — `DashboardFlowStore`: the authoritative per-flow record store and the
//! on-wire capture seam that feeds the transformation inspector + metrics.
//!
//! This module holds STORE LOGIC ONLY. The capped + redacting body serializer and
//! the single sensitive-key authority live in [`crate::redaction`] (D1 R1 #10), so
//! there is exactly one definition of "what is sensitive" and one O(CAP) capture
//! primitive shared with the inbound-trace logger.
//!
//! Dashboard flow architecture:
//! - The store is `DashboardFlowStore { state: Mutex<DashboardFlowState> }` with a
//!   `MonitorHub`-style `new()`/`disabled()` split: when `--with-debug-ui` is off
//!   the store is `disabled()` and EVERY operation is a no-op, so the production
//!   hot path keeps zero overhead.
//! - `by_id` (the record map) and `order` (the LRU/insertion deque) are mutated
//!   together under the ONE `Mutex` — there is no exterior LRU that could drift.
//! - Records are `Arc<FlowRecord>` replaced copy-on-write on mutation: each
//!   mutator clones the inner record, edits the clone, and swaps the `Arc`. The
//!   `claim: Arc<AtomicU8>` is CLONED (shared) across COW copies so the atomic
//!   identity persists for D3's `OpenL0 → ClaimedL1 → Finalized` CAS guard. D1
//!   only ALLOCATES `claim` as `OpenL0`; D3 owns the transitions.
//! - Bodies are owned, capped `Arc<[u8]>` produced by the redacting STREAMING JSON
//!   serializer in `redaction`: peak serializer memory is O(CAP), not O(body), and
//!   a `Bytes::slice` of the inbound middleware buffer bounded by `max_request_body_bytes` is NEVER retained (a slice
//!   keeps the whole backing allocation alive — AGENTS.md don't-rule). Secrets are
//!   redacted INLINE (sensitive keys, image URIs incl. `\uXXXX`-escaped forms,
//!   over-long scalars + keys), so no secret persists even in a preview.
//! - Every dynamic scalar string the record retains (ids, method, uri, models,
//!   upstream target, terminal reason) is CAPPED at `SCALAR_CAP` and COUNTED in
//!   `live_summary_bytes` (D1 R1 #5).
//! - The live store enforces three caps under the same lock AFTER EVERY mutation
//!   AND on every read: the record count (512), a 30-minute TTL, and a total live
//!   summary-byte quota (64 MiB) that evicts OLDEST BODIES first (sets their body
//!   `Arc`s to `None`; the record stays as a body-free summary).
//! - Snapshots (`snapshot_summaries`) are BODY-FREE (`SnapshotFlowSummary`) — body
//!   retention on historical snapshots recreates a 135 GiB worst case (D5 owns the
//!   ring; D1 just exposes the body-free summary projection).
